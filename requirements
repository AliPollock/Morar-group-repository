We want to develop a time booking system that can allow logged-in users to:

1. Register Projects and Tasks.
2. Have user roles (Admin or time booker).
3. Admins can assign users to projects or tasks.
4. Any assigned user can book time periods against the project or task with notes (on what was
done) plus the start time and end time of the time booked.
5. Users should have to login and only be allowed to book to project or tasks they have been
assigned to.
6. The system should allow web and mobile access. A disconnected mobile app would be an
interesting addition.

Questions for the customer:

Can admins book time periods? 
Can admins assign themselves to projects?  
What is the relation between time booker and admin? Is there certain projects/tasks only for time bookers? 
What are time periods? 
What are projects/ tasks? Are tasks components of a project? 
Who is the time booking system for? Are we to come up with our own scenario? 
Is the mobile app an “must have”? 
Is there any other type of user?
