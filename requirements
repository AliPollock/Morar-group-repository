We want to develop a time booking system that can allow logged-in users to:

1. Register Projects and Tasks.
2. Have user roles (Admin or time booker).
3. Admins can assign users to projects or tasks.
4. Any assigned user can book time periods against the project or task with notes (on what was
done) plus the start time and end time of the time booked.
5. Users should have to login and only be allowed to book to project or tasks they have been
assigned to.
6. The system should allow web and mobile access. A disconnected mobile app would be an
interesting addition.

Questions for the customer:

Can admins book time periods?
Admins can modify the booking - they can move/approve/ book time bookings

Can admins assign themselves to projects?
No
Multiple admins can assign users to the same project


What is the relation between time booker and admin? Is there certain projects/tasks only for time bookers?
Create a first admin (superadmin) that cannot be deleted and can create admin users

What are time periods?
Time periods are logs of work done on a project to calculate what to charge for a project/task

What are projects/ tasks? 
Tasks are components of projects - projects can have multiple tasks that can be assigned to different users

Who is the time booking system for? Are we to come up with our own scenario?


Is the mobile app an “must have”?


Is there any other type of user? 
No 
Keep it as one billing rate for timebooker users
